=== about HyperHelp ===

hyper help helps you to help - you help me - i help you - everybody helps everybody - opensource - one and for all.

=== The mission statement is: ===
“People have skills and want to be valued – why is there nobody giving proper value to those people and their skills?

So they develop a kind of feeling to be “unwanted” in the community of man.

Which is not true – it is the framework that devalues their skills – heavily damaging their selfesteem.

Those highly intelligent and trained people that work in and for the financial sector perform tasks that are boring, repetitive and completely worthless for mankind or even damaging.

It is a stupid game people should refuse to play along.

We need new creative socially engaging games and their makers.

HyperHelp.org wants to change that and is one such game.

If it works? You can not find out until you try it ;) In your family, school, university, community or soccer club.

If you donate your time to the best of mankind, to your community, a soccer club or anything – without receiving money – you can “book it in” into HyperHelp.org or start your own local HyperHelp-Server with equipment less than 100€.

This should enable to build communities and help peaceful cooperation between humans and reduce environment and social problems – that nobody is willing to fix in the current monetary system, because nobody gives you a loan if you say – you want to build a better world for everybody – it is not a business model that returns 6% of interest.

Absurd: Things that make perfectly sense are not monetary valued by the current monetary system.”
