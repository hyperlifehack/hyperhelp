oo whenever there is an action performed, the receiving user get's an email "action this and that was performed by ... please rate and comment on that action" 

=== sync with other installations ===
oo there should be no central server, instead, every server offers a download-link for the open-source-server-software.
oo when an interested user downloads the server-software,
the syncservers.php file is updated to contain the full list of up-to-date known servers that are running the software,
so the new server can sync it's data with them.

== scan for servers ==

on the admin-panel of every server, there should be an "scan for sync-servers" functionality, that:

1. either uses php to scan for servers running that software
2. fires up some c-writtern linux-bash-tool to do the job even quicker

=== pre-installed servers and hardware ===
